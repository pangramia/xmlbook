# xmlbook
Supplementary materials for Alexander Perez Tchernov's  'XML-technology: lecture course' book, that is going to be published in 2016. 

This repo is just a stub that is needed for the Publisher to make some links and QR codes. All examples from the book will be populated later at the time of actual publishing.
